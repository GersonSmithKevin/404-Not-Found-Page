## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

### Major Learnings

One of the key takeaways from this project was learning how to use media queries to adjust styles for different screen sizes. For example, I learned how to implement responsive design using CSS media queries to ensure that elements are properly displayed on mobile screens.

Here is a code snippet highlighting how I used media queries:

```css
/* Adjustments for mobile screens */
@media (max-width: 375px) {
  .mirrow {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    flex-direction: column;
    /* Aligns elements vertically in the center */
  }
}

```
