## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

### Major Learnings

One of the key takeaways from this project was learning how to use media queries to adjust styles for different screen sizes. For example, I learned how to implement responsive design using CSS media queries to ensure that elements are properly displayed on mobile screens.

Here is a code snippet highlighting how I used media queries:

```css
/* Adjustments for mobile screens */
@media (max-width: 375px) {
  .mirrow {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    flex-direction: column;
    /* Aligns elements vertically in the center */
  }
}

```

### Continued development

In future projects, I will continue to focus on improving my skills in aligning HTML elements with CSS to enhance responsive design. This includes refining techniques for positioning elements effectively and ensuring that layouts adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes. Mastering these alignment techniques will help in creating more polished and user-friendly designs.
